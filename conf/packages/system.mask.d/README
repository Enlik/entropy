This directory should contain distribution-provided configuration files
extending /etc/entropy/packages/system.mask content.
User should rather edit /etc/entropy/packages/system.mask instead of
creating files inside this directory.

Files are processed in lexical order. Filenames: ".keep", "README" and
starting with "_" are skipped and never considered.
