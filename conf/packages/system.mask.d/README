This directory should contain distribution-provided configuration files
extending /etc/entropy/packages/system.mask content.
User should rather edit /etc/entropy/packages/system.mask instead of
creating files inside this directory.

Files are processed in lexical order. ".keep" and "README" files are
skipped and never considered.
