# Server side packages.server.dep_rewrite file (this has to stay in /etc/entropy/packages)
# Using this file, you can apply arbitrary transformations to
# package dependencies via regular expressions.
# It can be used in case of Source Package Managers not properly
# splitting packages (and thus, dependencies), making possible to
# rewrite dependency strings without forking packages.

# LINE CONSTRUCTION:
# <::pkg::> <::dep_pattern::> <::dep_replace_1::> [<::dep_replace_2::> ...]
# ::pkg:: = package containing dependency to match
# ::dep_pattern:: = regexp of dependency to match
# ::dep_replace_1:: = replacement regexp
# ::dep_replace_n:: = additional replacement regexps (producing more deps out
#                     of one initially available)
# This is the function used for dependency rewrite:
# http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.sub
# See examples below

# EXAMPLES:
# media-gfx/foo media-sound/bar media-sound/baz
