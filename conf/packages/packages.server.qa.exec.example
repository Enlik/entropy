# Entropy Server QA executable hook.
# This file doesn't strictly need to be a shell script, but just an executable
# file (r-xr-xr-x) and (mandatory) owned by root:root.
# Please rename this file by stripping the .example part
#
# It is used by Entropy Server QA routines to perform package metadata
# validation.
# Metadata is exported as environmental variables and stdin.
#
# Metadata from environment:
# REPOSITORY_ID = repository identifier
# PKG_ID = package identifier
# PKG_ATOM = package atom
# PKG_NAME = package name
# PKG_VERSION = package version
# PKG_TAG = package version tag
# PKG_DESCRIPTION = package description
# PKG_CATEGORY = package category
# PKG_CHOST = package CHOST
# PKG_CFLAGS = package CFLAGS
# PKG_CXXFLAGS = package CXXFLAGS
# PKG_HOMEPAGE = package homepage
# PKG_LICENSE = package license
# PKG_BRANCH = package license
# PKG_DOWNLOAD = package relative download URL
# PKG_KEYWORDS = package keywords, space separated
# PKG_MD5 = package file md5 hash
# PKG_SLOT = package slot
# PKG_ETPAPI = package Entropy API
# PKG_DATE = package creation date (in unix time)
# PKG_SIZE = package size, in bytes
# PKG_REVISION = package entropy revision
# PKG_DEPS = list (\n separated) of package dependencies and conflicts

# Metadata on stdin (more can be added in the future, so it's advisable
# to ignore entries well formed but with unknown prefix):
# PKG_NEEDED_LIB:
#	SONAME required by package (one per line), including ELF class,
#	so each line will look like this:
#     PKG_NEEDED_LIB|<soname>|<elfclass>
# PKG_PROVIDED_LIB:
#	SONAME provided by package (one per line), note: elf class
#	and path are also provided, so each line will look like this:
#     PKG_PROVIDED_LIB|<soname>|<path of soname>|<elfclass>
#
# The executable must return 0 for success, 1 for warning, 2 for critical error
