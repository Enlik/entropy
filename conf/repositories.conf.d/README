This directory should contain distribution-provided configuration files
extending /etc/entropy/repositories.conf content (only for "repository ="
statements).

Files are processed in lexical order. Filenames: ".keep", "README" and 
starting with "_" are skipped and never considered. 

Files created by Entropy Client are prefixed with
"entropy_". So, for example, for "sabayon-limbo" you will get:
"entropy_sabayon-limbo".
