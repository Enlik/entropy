# Database format used by EAPI1 packages:
# bz2 or gz
database-format|bz2

# Disabled EAPIs (comma separated).
# By default, all current EAPI implementations are supported (1, 2, 3).
# This means that when uploading/downloading database files, a lot of
# redoundant transfers take place. You can decide to disable EAPI1, EAPI2, EAPI3
# or 2 of them. You cannot disable all of them, in this case this setting will
# be ignored.
#
# WARNING: USE-AT-YOUR-OWN-RISK. I mean, use it with brain_on(): entropy clients
# tries to fetch repositories starting from the highest EAPI supported and scale
# down to 2 and 1 if error occurs. So, if you are disabling EAPI3 and 2 and want
# to keep EAPI1, make sure to remove "unmaintained" files from your remote mirror.
# A fast way to achieve this is removing the whole remote database dir and re-upload
# everything (backup first!).

# WARNING: E X P E R I M E N T A L
# Automatic multiple packages support through expiration.
# If you enable this option, your repository will feature multiple package
# versions support inside the same scope (key + slot + tag).
# It is disabled by default.
# To enable this feature you need to explicitly tell Entropy the packages
# that can be kept by creating a file in the repository database dir called:
# "packages.db.fatscope", listing atoms one per line. Wildcard char (*) can
# be used to enable the feature on all packages.
# ATTENTION !!!: still, there is one unsolved "bad behaviour" for now.
# Due to the nature of OSS libraries (breaking API/ABI every odd day),
# YOU are responsible of potential older packages inconsistencies due to this.

# Online RSS support to track changes of the things happened on the database.
# Here are basic settings, like the ability to enable/disable this feature or

# Feed will be uploaded on the same packages.db.[bz2|gz] directory
