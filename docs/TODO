TODO list

Proposed for Entropy 1.0 (before and after) (requires API changes, perhaps):

  1.0_beta1:

    - equo --strict dep option
    - Documentation + code style cleanup (NLnet Milestone 7)
        http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/epydoc.html

  1.0_beta2:

    - PackageKit integration

  1.0 - deprecations:

    - databaseStructureUpdates (missing tables creation)
    - EAPI3 get_package_info methods that return package content metadata
    - EAPI2 old database dump upload
    - EAPI1 compressed database upload w/o content metadata (add, don't remove
        old one) => make EAPI3 service unpacking this instead of having
        to upload an uncompressed one

  2.0:

    - PackageKit improved support
    - UGC based on XML requests (all the commands into one string)
