TODO list

Proposed for Entropy 1.0 (before and after) (requires API changes, perhaps):

  0.95:

    - Move Trigger.trigger_configure_boot_grub & friends to ebuild (make Trigger more agnostic)
        -> next kernel 2.6.30

    - Spritz codebase refactoring (fileupdates: show changes button using internal viewer)
        - iron out multi-threading and GTK issues ? (if any)
        - Add all button doesn't effectively add all the packages to the queue or
        - when calculating the queue some packages are excluded for unknown reasons
        - view mode menu for the main treeview
        - Implement entropy:// URI handler
        - Smart applications desktop handler
        - message when a repo is not avail, asking to download (same for equo?)

    Only if possible:
    - server side upload digest verification (ditch crappy handlers?)
    - remove db.WriteLock?

    - server-side: old branch remote packages move (when a branch is dropped,
        remote packages should be moved to another location)

  1.0_beta1:

    - Documentation (NLnet Milestone 7)
    - LZMA (needs Python 2.6)
