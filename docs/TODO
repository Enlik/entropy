Backlog (raw)

  1.0:

    rigo:

    - [F] Notice Board

    - [F] Preferences:
       - clean metadata cache
       - clean recent searches
       - logout (clean session info)
       - update repositories
       - show confupdates

    magneto:
      - require rigo instead of sulfur? (launch rigo || sulfur)
      - gtk3 version
      - migrate to RigoDaemon as soon as it's available!
        - and also Equo (text_repositories)

    - make security advisories caching faster (cache server-side?)

    - drop bashism from entropy.spm (/bin/bash used)
    - eit remote (for handling repos in server.conf)
    - rework client/ code, as done with eit
      - ditch etpUi

    - conditional deps support, implement in entropy.spm,
      class is there (add unit test)

  1.0, long term:

    - move variables away from etpConst
      (to SystemSettings || Client || Server as static methods)

  1.1:

    - pkgcore spm plugin
        PF CATEGORY CFLAGS CXXFLAGS NEEDED are missing
    - ditch close_repositories() for commit_repositories() when possible
    - python 3.x support -> more tests

  break backward compat:
      - deprecate "repository =" statements from repositories.conf
      - enable baseinfo-extrainfo-2010 tables
        test removal (reverse deps could be problematic?) -- add resolved dep
        instead of full conditional?
