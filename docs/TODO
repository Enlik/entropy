TODO list

Proposed for Entropy 1.0 (before and after) (requires API changes, perhaps):

  0.90:

    - Put SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512 signatures to work on the Client.
    - use expiration as a base to have and handle multiple packages in repo?
    - Entropy repository daemon facilities (init script, config, etc)
    - Updates daemon + shrink notification applet? (dev-python/dbus-python)

  1.0_beta1:

    - Documentation (NLnet Milestone 7) + man pages (complete)

    - Spritz codebase refactoring (fileupdates: show changes button using internal viewer)
        - Add all button doesn't effectively add all the packages to the queue or
        - when calculating the queue some packages are excluded for unknown reasons

    - Move Trigger.trigger_configure_boot_grub & friends to ebuild (make Trigger more agnostic)
        -> next kernel 2.6.30

    - System Package Set representing what's inside a stock distribution
        - Connect Smart applications to it to filter out common deps and eventually make it usable
        - Implement Smart applications in Spritz too
        - Implement entropy:// URI handler

    - LZMA future support
