Backlog (raw)

  1.0:

    rigo:
    - requires pygobject[cairo,introspection]
    - requires dbus
    - requires polkit [introspection]
    - install simulation -> rigo:simulate:i:<dep>
    - removal simulation -> rigo:simulate:r:<dep>

    - [F] App Install support
          - implement removal
          - inform about apps being removed due to install?
          - make possible to undo accidental enqueue, give 5 seconds?
            -> Undo feature via NotificationBox?

    - [F] System Upgrade support
    - [F] Configuration files Update

    - preferences:
       - clean metadata cache
       - clean recent searches
       - logout (clean session info)
       - update repositories
       - reload RigoDaemon (via reload())

    magneto:
      - migrate to RigoDaemon as soon as it's available!
        - and also Equo (text_repositories)
      - gtk3 version
      - singleton!

    - make security advisories caching faster (cache server-side?)

    - drop bashism from entropy.spm (/bin/bash used)
    - eit remote (for handling repos in server.conf)
    - rework client/ code, as done with eit
      - ditch etpUi

    - conditional deps support, implement in entropy.spm,
      class is there (add unit test)

  1.0, long term:

    - move variables away from etpConst
      (to SystemSettings || Client || Server as static methods)

  1.1:

    - pkgcore spm plugin
        PF CATEGORY CFLAGS CXXFLAGS NEEDED are missing
    - ditch close_repositories() for commit_repositories() when possible
    - python 3.x support -> more tests

  break backward compat:
      - deprecate "repository =" statements from repositories.conf
      - enable baseinfo-extrainfo-2010 tables
        test removal (reverse deps could be problematic?) -- add resolved dep
        instead of full conditional?
