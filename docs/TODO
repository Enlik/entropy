  0.99.50:

    EntropyRepositoryBase:
    - entropy.tools: move version checking functions to SPM (and use spm ones?)
    - md5/sha of pkg files in db
    - searchEclassedPackages...
    - _connection() (used in contentDiff)
    - rename dropAllIndexes to pack
    - rename "equo database"
    - remove "branch" from EntropyRepository.searchPackages

  1.0:

    - reagent/activator, do not use stuff like server_reagent.Entropy.blah()
    - per-repository mirrors on repo database dir?
    - uniform config files options to this-and-that (keeping backward compat)
      alternatively use "=" instead of "|"
    - sulfur: ask password as user and allow installation?
    - implement system snapshots (as snapshots, sets).
    - Client.urlFetcher/MultipleUrlFetcher/clientLog? ugly!
    - entropy package metadata .dtd specs
    - entropy.client API docs

  1.1:

    - PackageKit replacement
    - UGC based on XML requests (all the commands into one string)
