Backlog (raw)

  1.0:

    - eit remote (for handling repos in server.conf)
    - rework client/ code, as done with eit
      - ditch etpUi

    - dump Sulfur
      once done, rewrite entropy.Security() interface
      to be O(1).

    - conditional deps:
      enabled with ETP_PORTAGE_CONDITIONAL_DEPS_ENABLE
      Test package generation and entropy client behaviour
      (both direct and inverse dependencies calculation)

  1.0, long term:

    - move variables away from etpConst
      (to SystemSettings || Client || Server as static methods)

  1.1:

    - pkgcore spm plugin
        NEEDED are missing
    - python 3.x support -> more tests

  break backward compat:
      - enable baseinfo-extrainfo-2010 tables
