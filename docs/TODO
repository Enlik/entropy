TODO list

Proposed for Entropy 1.0 (before and after) (requires API changes, perhaps):

  0.99:

    - entropy.tools + entropy.transceivers API docs in place

  1.0_beta1:

    - entropy.server API
    - entropy.db hookable plugins support (atom/dep validation, db taint,
        pkg add, pkg rm)
    - entropy.client hookable plugin support for SPM
    - Transform Sulfur into Entropy Store:
        - UGC for more coolness
        - title change
        - more sexy UI
    - Sulfur: when window is maximized, pkgs description must be longer

  1.0_beta2:

    - PackageKit integration

  1.0 - deprecations:

    - _databaseStructureUpdates (missing tables creation)
    - type argument in updateProgress
    - clientDbconn => clientdb

  2.0:

    - PackageKit improved support
    - UGC based on XML requests (all the commands into one string)
