Backlog (raw)

  1.0:

    - splitdebug: use separate files?

    - graph improvements:
        - graph with or dependencies support
        - graph with weighted edges (nvidia-userspace:0 must not collide with something
          already pulled in)

    - complete README
        - when upgrading branch, drop packages.db.critical
    - use standard arguments parser?
    - when entropy does pkg name moves, also update config files?
        via SystemSettings, updatable config files list returned by plugins

  break backward compat:
      - enable baseinfo-extrainfo-2010 tables
      - conditional deps support, implement in entropy.spm, class is there (add unit test)
        test removal (reverse deps could be problematic?) -- add resolved dep
        instead of full conditional?
        see how they interact with packages.server.dep_rewrite
