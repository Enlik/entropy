TODO list

Proposed for Entropy 1.0 (before and after) (requires API changes, perhaps):

  0.95:

    - Spritz codebase refactoring:
        - simple mode vs extended mode
        - Implement entropy:// URI handler

    - Smart applications desktop handler
    - server-side: old branch remote packages move (when a branch is dropped,
        remote packages should be moved to another location)

  1.0_beta1:

    - Move Trigger.trigger_configure_boot_grub & friends to ebuild (make Trigger more agnostic)
        -> next kernel 2.6.30
        -> split kernel sources from kernel bins?

    - Documentation (NLnet Milestone 7)
    - LZMA (needs Python 2.6) ?
