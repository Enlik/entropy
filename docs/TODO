Backlog (raw)

  1.0:

    rigo:
    - requires pygobject[cairo]
    - requires dbus
    - [F] repositories not available, update?
    - [F] show progress -> add bottom notification area
          (permanent notifications)
    - [F] when updating repos, clear all the upper notifications
    - [F] recover from Repository Update execution
    - [F] recover from Application Install / Remove execution
    - [F] show App Information while Installing / Removing
    - [F] at the end of Work View execution, ask before switching back
    - [F] implement authentication

    magneto:
      - migrate to RigoDaemon as soon as it's available!
        - and also Equo (text_repositories)
      - gtk3 version
      - singleton!

    - make security advisories caching faster (cache server-side?)
    - eit remote (for handling repos in server.conf)
    - rework client/ code, as done with eit
      - ditch etpUi

    - conditional deps support, implement in entropy.spm,
      class is there (add unit test)

  1.0, long term:

    - move variables away from etpConst
      (to SystemSettings || Client || Server as static methods)

  1.1:

    - pkgcore spm plugin
        PF CATEGORY CFLAGS CXXFLAGS NEEDED are missing
    - ditch close_repositories() for commit_repositories() when possible
    - python 3.x support -> more tests

  break backward compat:
      - deprecate "repository =" statements from repositories.conf
      - enable baseinfo-extrainfo-2010 tables
        test removal (reverse deps could be problematic?) -- add resolved dep
        instead of full conditional?
