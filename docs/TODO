  0.99.50:

    EntropyRepositoryBase:
    - 3. move update() code to Entropy server db class (change semantic?)
    - entropy.tools: move version checking functions to SPM (and use spm ones?)

  1.0:

    - make sure that every equo command properly uses entropy locks
        smart, security, cache, repositories?
    - uniform config files options to this-and-that (keeping backward compat)
      alternatively use "=" instead of "|"
    - reagent/activator, do not use stuff like server_reagent.Entropy.blah()
    - implement system snapshots (as snapshots, sets).
    - Client.urlFetcher/MultipleUrlFetcher/clientLog? ugly!
    - entropy.db.search* unittest
    - entropy package metadata .dtd specs
    - entropy.client API docs

  1.1:

    - PackageKit replacement
    - UGC based on XML requests (all the commands into one string)
