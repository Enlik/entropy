Backlog (raw)

  1.0:
    REAGENT:

    - entropy server:
        - if local repo < remote repo, repo should be downloaded first
          then packages.
        - do not use implicit pull when push is selected, block push if
          local repo is older than remote, implement some kind of atomic
          remote locking to guarantee mutual exclusion.

    - pkgcore spm plugin
        PF CATEGORY CFLAGS CXXFLAGS NEEDED FEATURES INHERITED are missing

    - fine grained locking support
      (acquire entropy resources lock only when really needed
        [eit add vs eit graph --> needed? pkg_id no more avail])
      kill the Big Entropy Lock :-)

  1.1:

    - ditch close_repositories() for commit_repositories() when possible
    - python 3.x support -> more tests
    - sulfur: rewrite using pygtk3

  break backward compat:
      - enable baseinfo-extrainfo-2010 tables
      - conditional deps support, implement in entropy.spm, class is there (add unit test)
        test removal (reverse deps could be problematic?) -- add resolved dep
        instead of full conditional?
