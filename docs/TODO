TODO list

Proposed for Entropy 1.0 (before and after) (requires API changes, perhaps):

  - fix double download on entropy.client.interfaces.Client (downloading from)
  - reagent spm pkgset-update
  - equo unusedpackages: add package size and order per it
  - track down packages installed as dependency and packages installed as user request
      in this way we could auto-removed unused deps
  - server-side deptest should only complain about the default repo
  - server-side timestamp creation on each upload (inside DB dir)


  - SHA512 instead of MD5
  - Improve packages injection speed
  - Move entropy client settings in etpConst to SystemSettings
  - Pylint roundup
  - LZMA
  - Spritz codebase refactoring (fileupdates: show changes button using internal viewer)
    - Add all button doesn't effectively add all the packages to the queue or
    - when calculating the queue some packages are excluded for unknown reasons
  - Unit Test module
  - Move Trigger.trigger_configure_boot_grub & friends to ebuild (reduce size of Trigger)
  - Updates daemon + shrink notification applet? (dev-python/dbus-python)
  - Documentation (NLnet Milestone 7)
  - System Package Set representing what's inside a stock distribution
    - Connect Smart applications to it to filter out common deps and eventually make it usable
      - Implement Smart applications in Spritz too
    - Implement entropy:// URI handler
  - use expiration as a base to have and handle multiple packages in repo?
  - Entropy repository daemon facilities (init script, config, etc)
