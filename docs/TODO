TODO list

Proposed for Entropy 1.0 (before and after) (requires API changes, perhaps):

  0.90+:

    - etpConst['dbconfigprotect'] to SystemSettings
    - etpConst['dbconfigprotectmask'] to SystemSettings
    - Unit Test module

    - Documentation + Pylint (NLnet Milestone 7)
    - use expiration as a base to have and handle multiple packages in repo?
    - Server-side: ability to exclude EAPIs when uploading?
    - Put SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512 signatures to work on the Client.
    - Updates daemon + shrink notification applet? (dev-python/dbus-python)
    - LZMA future support
    - Spritz codebase refactoring (fileupdates: show changes button using internal viewer)
        - Add all button doesn't effectively add all the packages to the queue or
        - when calculating the queue some packages are excluded for unknown reasons

    - Entropy repository daemon facilities (init script, config, etc)
    - Move Trigger.trigger_configure_boot_grub & friends to ebuild (make Trigger more agnostic)
        -> next kernel 2.6.30
    - Move Trigger.trigger_purgecache to entropy ebuild

    - System Package Set representing what's inside a stock distribution
        - Connect Smart applications to it to filter out common deps and eventually make it usable
        - Implement Smart applications in Spritz too
        - Implement entropy:// URI handler
