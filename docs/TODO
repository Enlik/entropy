TODO list

Proposed for Entropy 1.0 (before and after) (requires API changes, perhaps):

  0.90:

    - use expiration as a base to have and handle multiple packages in repo?
    - Updates daemon + shrink notification applet (dev-python/dbus-python)

  1.0_beta1:

    - Documentation (NLnet Milestone 7)

    - Spritz codebase refactoring (fileupdates: show changes button using internal viewer)
        - iron out multi-threading and GTK issues ? (if any)
        - Add all button doesn't effectively add all the packages to the queue or
        - when calculating the queue some packages are excluded for unknown reasons
        - view mode menu for the main treeview

    - Move Trigger.trigger_configure_boot_grub & friends to ebuild (make Trigger more agnostic)
        -> next kernel 2.6.30

    - Connect Smart applications stuff to system packages set
    - Implement Smart applications in Spritz too?
    - Implement entropy:// URI handler

    - LZMA future support (needs Python 2.6)
