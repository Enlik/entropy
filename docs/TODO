Backlog (raw)

  1.0:

    - ditch reagent and activator in favour of eit (make it usable with equo community tools too, ditch stuff from there)
        - use argparse
        - add "eit notice"
        - add "eit sets"
        - ceit (community repos eit)
        - add "eit revdeps"
        - add "eit fitin"
        - add man page

    - pkgcore spm plugin
        PF CATEGORY CFLAGS CXXFLAGS NEEDED FEATURES INHERITED are missing

    - fine grained locking support (acquire entropy resources lock only when really needed)
      kill the Big Entropy Lock :-)

    - graph improvements:
        - graph with or dependencies support
        - graph with weighted edges (nvidia-userspace:0 must not collide with something
          already pulled in)

  1.1:

    - python 3.x support -> more tests
    - sulfur: rewrite using pygtk3

  break backward compat:
      - enable baseinfo-extrainfo-2010 tables
      - conditional deps support, implement in entropy.spm, class is there (add unit test)
        test removal (reverse deps could be problematic?) -- add resolved dep
        instead of full conditional?
