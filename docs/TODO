TODO list

Proposed for Entropy 1.0 (before and after) (requires API changes, perhaps):

  1.0_beta1:

    - Sulfur: double click on package cats will show contained packages
    - when a new entropy version is available, don't allow any other update?
        # config file in /etc
        # priority update files
    - other 10 unit tests
    - Documentation + code style cleanup (NLnet Milestone 7)
        http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/epydoc.html

    - expiration thingus? (server-side) => .pkglist file that could be parsed
        # need to wait branch 5 now
    - branch migration script (pre, after?)
    - add debugging calls on entropy.client, server, entropy

  1.0_beta2:

    - PackageKit integration

  1.0 - deprecations:

    - databaseStructureUpdates (missing tables creation)
    - EAPI3 get_package_info methods that return package content metadata
    - EAPI2 old database dump upload
    - EAPI1 compressed database upload w/content table
    - drop all the deprecated repository uploads

  2.0:

    - PackageKit improved support
    - UGC based on XML requests (all the commands into one string)
