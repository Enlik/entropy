Backlog (raw)

  1.0:

    - make possible to embed ebuild content inside db repo (and drop old schema checks)

    - graph improvements:
        - graph with or dependencies support
        - graph with weighted edges (nvidia-userspace:0 must not collide with something
          already pulled in)

    - complete README
        - when upgrading branch, drop packages.db.critical

  break backward compat:
      - enable baseinfo-extrainfo-2010 tables
      - conditional deps support, implement in entropy.spm, class is there (add unit test)
        test removal (reverse deps could be problematic?) -- add resolved dep
        instead of full conditional?
