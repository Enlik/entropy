TODO list

Proposed for Entropy 1.0 (before and after) (requires API changes, perhaps):

  0.90:

    - use expiration as a base to have and handle multiple packages in repo?
    - Updates daemon + shrink notification applet (dev-python/dbus-python)

  0.95:

    - Move Trigger.trigger_configure_boot_grub & friends to ebuild (make Trigger more agnostic)
        -> next kernel 2.6.30

    - Spritz codebase refactoring (fileupdates: show changes button using internal viewer)
        - iron out multi-threading and GTK issues ? (if any)
        - Add all button doesn't effectively add all the packages to the queue or
        - when calculating the queue some packages are excluded for unknown reasons
        - view mode menu for the main treeview
        - Implement entropy:// URI handler
        - Smart applications desktop handler

    Only if possible:
    - server side upload digest verification (ditch crappy handlers?)
    - content table, is there anything that can be done?

  1.0_beta1:

    - Documentation (NLnet Milestone 7)
    - LZMA (needs Python 2.6)
