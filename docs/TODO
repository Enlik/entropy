TODO list

Proposed for Entropy 1.0 (before and after) (requires API changes, perhaps):

  1.0_beta1:

    - Move Trigger.trigger_configure_boot_grub & friends to ebuild (make Trigger more agnostic)
        -> next kernel 2.6.30
        -> split kernel sources from kernel bins?

    - Documentation + code style cleanup (NLnet Milestone 7)
