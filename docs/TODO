Backlog (raw)

  1.0:

    - entropy server:
        - if local repo < remote repo, repo should be downloaded first
          then packages.
        - do not use implicit pull when push is selected, block push if
          local repo is older than remote.
        - or simply: pull cmd == do not push; push cmd == do not pull

    - eit remote (for handling repos in server.conf)
    - rework client/ code, as done with eit
      - ditch etpUi

    - fine grained locking support
      (acquire entropy resources lock only when really needed
        [eit add vs eit graph --> needed? pkg_id no more avail])
      kill the Big Entropy Lock :-)

    - conditional deps support, implement in entropy.spm,
      class is there (add unit test)

  1.0, long term:

    - move variables away from etpConst
      (to SystemSettings || Client || Server as static methods)

  1.1:

    - pkgcore spm plugin
        PF CATEGORY CFLAGS CXXFLAGS NEEDED FEATURES INHERITED are missing
    - ditch close_repositories() for commit_repositories() when possible
    - python 3.x support -> more tests
    - sulfur: rewrite using pygtk3

  break backward compat:
      - deprecate "repository =" statements from repositories.conf
      - enable baseinfo-extrainfo-2010 tables
        test removal (reverse deps could be problematic?) -- add resolved dep
        instead of full conditional?
