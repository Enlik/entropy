Backlog (raw)

  1.0:

    - if repo is opened using open_repository() cannot use close(), avoid by design

    - downgrade-repo, if enabled, puts the to-be-upgraded
        package to a separate repo before overwriting
        => higher priority than all other repos
        => no packages mirror
        => "equo downgrade" (installs all the packages from the downgrade-repo)

    - entropy.client: refactoring
    - entropy.services: refactoring
        rewrite UGC using HTTP protocol

    - python3.x tests
        entropy ugc fixes
        xorg-server install problem? /etc/init.d/xdm was not found

    - evaluate or-dependencies after complete dependency graph calculation.
        definitely fixes or dependencies

    - complete README

  break backward compat:
      - enable baseinfo-extrainfo-2010 tables
      - conditional deps support, implement in entropy.spm, class is there (add unit test)
