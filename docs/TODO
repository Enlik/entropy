Backlog (raw)

  1.0:

    - splitdebug: use separate files?
        bump packagekit

    - ditch reagent and activator in favour of eit (make it usable with equo community tools too, ditch stuff from there)
        - use argparse
        - add "eit notice"
        - add "eit sets"

    - graph improvements:
        - graph with or dependencies support
        - graph with weighted edges (nvidia-userspace:0 must not collide with something
          already pulled in)


  break backward compat:
      - enable baseinfo-extrainfo-2010 tables
      - conditional deps support, implement in entropy.spm, class is there (add unit test)
        test removal (reverse deps could be problematic?) -- add resolved dep
        instead of full conditional?
