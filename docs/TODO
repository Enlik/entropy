TODO list

Proposed for Entropy 1.0 (before and after) (requires API changes, perhaps):

  - merge all the server config files to server.conf?
  - iron out new FtpInterface
  - FtpInterface (upload ETA)
  - Entropy codebase => camelCase to underscore
  - Spritz codebase refactoring (fileupdates: show changes button using internal viewer)
    - Add all button doesn't effectively add all the packages to the queue or
    - when calculating the queue some packages are excluded for unknown reasons
  - Unit Test module
  - Move Trigger.trigger_configure_boot_grub & friends to ebuild (reduce size of Trigger)
  - Updates daemon + shrink notification applet? (dev-python/dbus-python)
  - Autobuild system (NLnet Milestone 6)
  - Documentation + man page (NLnet Milestone 7)
  - System Package Set representing what's inside a stock distribution
    - Connect Smart applications to it to filter out common deps and eventually make it usable
      - Implement Smart applications in Spritz too
    - Implement entropy:// URI handler
  - use expiration as a base to have and handle multiple packages in repo?
  - UGC: personal package sets
  - UGC: bug report documents?
  - UGC: bbcode docs?
  - SSL improvements
  - Entropy repository daemon facilities (init script, config, etc)
