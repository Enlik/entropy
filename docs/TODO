TODO list

Proposed for Entropy 1.0 (before and after) (requires API changes, perhaps):

  1.0_beta1:

    - system has two tagged pkgs installed, if one is removed, spm entry got
        removed too. spm should ask entropy if other pkgs are installed and if
        so, update spm uid connection and NOT remove its entry.
        => if another entry is available (spm should avoid to run the phase and
            forget?)
    - entropy.tools + entropy.transceivers API docs merge
    - entropy.client.interfaces.trigger, move Portage code to entropy.spm
    - entropy.server API docs merge
    - entropy.db hookable plugins support (atom/dep validation, db taint,
        pkg add, pkg rm)
    - Transform Sulfur into Entropy Store:
        - UGC for more coolness
        - title change
        - more sexy UI
    - Sulfur: when window is maximized, pkgs description must be longer
    - Magneto: disable applet when running on batteries

  1.0_beta2:

    - PackageKit integration

  1.0 - deprecations:

    - _databaseStructureUpdates (missing tables creation)
    - type argument in updateProgress
    - clientDbconn => clientdb

  2.0:

    - PackageKit improved support
    - UGC based on XML requests (all the commands into one string)
