TODO list

Entropy 0.52:
 - /usr/sbin/entropy.sh install
 - dependency on sandbox
 - equo/reagent/activator: bind to python2

Proposed for Entropy 1.0 (before and after) (requires API changes, perhaps):

  - Updates daemon + shrink notification applet? (dev-python/dbus-python)
  - Autobuild system (NLnet Milestone 6)
  - Documentation + man page (NLnet Milestone 7)
  - System Package Set representing what's inside a stock distribution
    - Connect Smart applications to it to filter out common deps and eventually make it usable
      - Implement Smart applications in Spritz too
    - Implement entropy:// URI handler
  - Entropy codebase refactoring
  - Spritz codebase refactoring
  - use expiration as a base to have and handle multiple packages in repo?
  - UGC: personal package sets
  - UGC: bug report documents?
  - UGC: bbcode docs?
  - SSL improvements
  - Unit Test module
  - Entropy repository daemon facilities (init script, config, etc)
