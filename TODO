TODO list:
- reagent: complete smartapps section
  CLIENT:
  - trap elogs when running enzyme and add them to the database, maybe I can write a file and then let reagent look for it
  - add etc-update-alike support
  - add preinst/postinst/prerm/postrm scripts
  - centralized management?
  - have a look why dev-dotnet/pe-format-0 is being pulled in
  - during removal/add handle:
	- /etc/init.d/* files ?
	- GConf2 database
	- desktop mime database
	- shared mime database
	- scrollkeeper database
	- icons cache
	- fonts cache (run mkfontdir after writes in /usr/share/fonts)
  - add support for PDEPEND
  - split world function in "world update" and "world upgrade" (do the latter first)
  - branch reorganization based on the release:
    - install only looks inside the configured branch
    - world looks inside the latest (if run with "upgrade")
