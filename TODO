TODO list (for developers only):
- timestamp management across database and packages servers
- a general option --info to print all the Entropy variables and constants
- add a wrapper for qfile and qlist portage-utils tools because our internal repository is at /var/lib/entropy/portage
- fix: python enzyme build planner --> ambiguos ebuilds' name
