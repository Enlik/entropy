TODO list (for developers only):
- timestamp management across database and packages servers
- hash management (like Manifest in gentoo)
- write rules for exit codes
- add digest funcionality and tool to reagent
- a lot more :-P

~cvill64 suggestion
- allow "package|mirrors://binhost/%Arch% to be recognized instead of just one per line
