TODO list (for developers only):
- add a wrapper for qfile and qlist portage-utils tools because our internal repository is at /var/lib/entropy/portage
- add proper SLOTS, FETCH_RESTRICTION support to enzyme, getBestAtom and so on... (maybe directly using emerge output?)
- try to workout the mtime issue of repackaged .tbz2

Project Status:
- entropy: not yet started, nothing to say then
- enzyme: build() is more or less ok, world() needs to be implemented, overlay() and sync() along with cleanup() are fine
- reagent: first release up and working.
- activator: not yet started, I need to prepare a ftp module that let us work without rsync and shit like that
============
- client part: not yet defined apart from equilibrium name.
