TODO list (for developers only):
- timestamp management across database and packages servers
- hash management (like Manifest in gentoo)
- write rules for exit codes
- store etpData['md5'] and use it to choose if there is the needing of a version bump of the .etp file
- a lot more :-P

~cvill64 suggestion
- allow "package|mirrors://binhost/%Arch% to be recognized instead of just one per line
