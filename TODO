TODO list

  - server-side db backup tool
  - implement pdepend support in dependencies sorting
  - add changelog to packages
  - split entropy.py into entropy package (move exceptionTools to something saner)
  - move etpConst['conflicting_tagged_packages'] elsewhere
  - move etpConst['filesystemdirs'] and etpConst['filesystemdirsmask'] to config file
  - automatic client db backup
  - find a way to better handle real smartapps deps (need split PDEPEND?)
  - documentation + man page

  - External trigger: rewrite support and use bash
  - use expiration as a base to have and handle multiple packages in repo?
