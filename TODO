TODO list

Proposed for Entropy 0.6+ (before and after) (requires API changes, perhaps):

  - Documentation + man page (NLnet Milestone 7)
  - System Package Set representing what's inside a stock distribution
    - Connect Smart applications to it to filter out common deps and eventually make it usable
      - Implement Smart applications in Spritz too
    - Implement entropy:// URI handler
  - Entropy codebase refactoring
  - OpenGL setup with NVIDIA, again
  - External trigger: rewrite support and use bash
  - use expiration as a base to have and handle multiple packages in repo?
  - UGC: personal package sets
  - UGC: bug report documents?
  - UGC: bbcode docs?
  - GIT migration
  - Spritz: show package changelog entry
