TODO list (for developers only):
- add proper FETCH_RESTRICTION support to enzyme, getBestAtom and so on... (maybe directly using emerge output?)
- activator should care about the removal of the old packages
- build() on enzyme, when calculating runtime dependencies, please check if there's a broken link too and report as warning
- build() on enzyme, also trap einfo and ewarn ?
- build() and world(), on enzyme, add the support for whitelist+cron
- build(), on enzyme, beautify sanity check when all the packages are not found
- Sabayon Linux USE flags: remove all server related use flags

Project Status:
- entropy: not yet started, nothing to say then
- enzyme: build() is more or less ok, world() needs to be implemented, the rest is fine
- reagent: first release up and working.
- activator: not yet started, I need to prepare a ftp module that let us work without rsync and shit like that
============
- client part: not yet defined apart from equilibrium name.


Features plan:
- distcc support to enzyme
