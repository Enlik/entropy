TODO list:
- reagent: complete smartapps section
  CLIENT:
  - complete etc-update alike support
  - on disk caching for all user commands
  - during removal/add handle (trigger functions):
	- /etc/init.d/* files ? # removal
	- kernel modules (depmod and moduledb)
  - world upgrade should switch python to 2.5
  - remove TAGS and substitute them with forced SLOT setting (just keep it for the package filename)
  - branch reorganization based on the release:
    - install only looks inside the configured branch
  - if a mirror fails several times, disable it
  - move branches to version naming (3.5, 3.6, 3.7) instead of using stable, unstable...
  - embed python and pysqlite to avoid dependency from the one installed on the system
