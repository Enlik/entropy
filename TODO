TODO list (for developers only):
- build() and world(), on enzyme, add the support for whitelist+cron
- build(), on enzyme, add license blacklist (packages that cannot be shipped in a binary form)
- improve logTools and put it in an usable status
- enzyme: add stronger support to broken packages check
- reagent: complete smartapps section
- mirrorTools: add PASV option (supported/not supported)
- enzyme, reagent: test kernel dependent packages
- enzyme, build(): add an option to force the continuation of the emerge queue even if a package fails
- enzyme, add a module that integrates revdep-rebuild
- add FXP support to activator ? (yes but dreamhost does not support it :|)
- entropy, needed part, add multithreading support

- entropy, databaseTools, finalize support for branches. There can be two packages with the same cat/name-version in the database but with different branch.
important things:

   CHANGES NEEDED:
      - when using retrievePackageVar must be specified the Branch
      - !!! add proper code to the stabilize/unstabilize function (move files locally and on the ftp)
   AT THE END:
      - recreate the database, reupload the new packages. resync mirrors.


- If a package is already pulled in, do not add twice:
dhcppc3 handlers # python enzyme overlay sync sabayon; python enzyme build networkmanager nm-applet knetworkmanager kpowersave --force-rebuild
>> synced overlay: sabayon
>>   Sanity check on packages...
>>   * These are the actions that will be taken, in order:
>>      * [BUILD] [U ] net-misc/networkmanager-0.6.5-r1 [overlay: 1 ]
>>      * [BUILD] [U ] net-misc/networkmanager-0.6.5-r1 [overlay: 1 ]
>>      * [BUILD] [N ] net-misc/nm-applet-0.6.5-r1 [overlay: 1 ]
>>      * [BUILD] [U ] net-misc/knetworkmanager-0.1-r3 [overlay: 1 ]
>>      * [BUILD] [RS] sys-power/kpowersave-0.7.2-r3 [overlay: 1 ]


!! Remember that kernel dependent packages have: sys-kernel/linux-core-2.6.20-sabayon-r3 (for example)

Project Status:
- entropy: will handle all the three tools below
- enzyme: complete. Needs bug fixes ?
- reagent: complete. Needs bug fixes.
- activator: complete. Needs bug fixes.
============
- client part: not yet defined apart from equilibrium name.


Features plan:
- enzyme: distcc support on cross platforms and on automake
- activator: add support for ssh (where supported) to we can md5sum the uploaded files?
