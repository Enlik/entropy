TODO list (for developers only):
- a general option --info to print all the Entropy variables and constants
- add a wrapper for qfile and qlist portage-utils tools because our internal repository is at /var/lib/entropy/portage
- add proper SLOTS, FETCH_RESTRICTION support to enzyme, getBestAtom and so on... (maybe directly using emerge output?)
