TODO list (for developers only):
- a general option --info to print all the Entropy variables and constants
- add a wrapper for qfile and qlist portage-utils tools because our internal repository is at /var/lib/entropy/portage
- fix: python enzyme build planner --> ambiguos ebuilds' name
- complete the uninstall() funcion in enzymeTools and unmerge unsermake
- there's a sneaky bug with the masked packages between the etp repo and the getBestAtom() function
- enzyme, build(), add USE flags management (packages must be recompiled if a USE flag is changed)
