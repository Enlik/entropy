TODO list (for developers only):
- a general option --info to print all the Entropy variables and constants
- add a wrapper for qfile and qlist portage-utils tools because our internal repository is at /var/lib/entropy/portage
- enzyme, build(), show use flags and status connected to a shown package (if it's installed --> N/U/R )
