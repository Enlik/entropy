TODO list (for developers only):
- implement logTools inside handlers
  - databaseTools
  - entropyTools
  - activatorTools
  - reagentTools
  - mirrorTools
  - portageTools
- reagent: complete smartapps section
- enzyme, reagent: test kernel dependent packages
- enzyme, build(): add an option to force the continuation of the emerge queue even if a package fails
- enzyme, add a module that integrates revdep-rebuild
- add FXP support to activator ? (yes but dreamhost does not support it :|)
- entropy, needed part, add multithreading support
