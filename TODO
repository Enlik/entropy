TODO list:
- reagent: complete smartapps section
  CLIENT:
  - handle libraries reverse lookup during install to assure a consistent system
  - add multithreading support
  - during removal/add handle (trigger functions):
	- complete preremove()
	- complete postremove()
	- complete preinstall()
	- complete postinstall()
	- new kernel? grub configuration at your service (add a trigger)
	- add kbuildsycoca trigger (using eclasses info)
	- if something is installed in /boot and this is a not mounted mountpoint, mount it (preinstall trigger)
	- if something is installed in /usr/lib/xorg/modules trigger eselect
  - remove TAGS and substitute them with forced SLOT setting (just keep it for the package filename)
  - branch reorganization based on the release:
    - install only looks inside the configured branch
  - move branches to version naming (3.5, 3.6, 3.7) instead of using stable, unstable...
  - add scripts directory that contains pre/post-install-remove scripts that is synced using activator
  - implement installation messages infrastructure (where are collected all installation messages)
  - add support for new atoms layout (cpv:SLOT)
  - on-disk/static cache for removal functions?
  - optimize database interface

Project Status:
- entropy: will handle all the three tools below
- reagent: complete. Stabilization mode.
- activator: complete. Stabilization mode.
